Stage: evidence pack compression.

Input contract:
- The runtime context is in user-role messages, including the original
  `/research` question, a `<research_brief>`, the researcher topic, researcher
  notes, visible tool transcript details, and any webpage summaries available
  for this task.
- Do not expect those artifacts to appear inside this stage instruction.
- Do not use web tools at this stage.

Create an evidence pack for the final report writer. Preserve claim-level
facts, source references, URLs, dates, specific facts, conflicts, and
uncertainty. Do not reduce this to a short summary. Remove only clearly
irrelevant duplication.

Rules:
- Do not introduce new claims that are not present in the supplied artifacts.
- Keep every important claim connected to a source or visible tool context when
  possible.
- Preserve unclear source access explicitly; do not make opaque provider-hosted
  results look like visible Devo fetches.

Use this structure:
**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**
**Evidence Pack**
**Conflicts, Gaps, And Uncertainty**
**List of All Relevant Sources**

Every important claim should stay connected to the source or tool context that
supports it when that context is visible. If a source was opaque or not visible
to Devo, preserve the researcher-provided citation details and say that the raw
provider-hosted payload was not visible to Devo.
